## üìã Overview

This project is a real-time Twitter sentiment analysis dashboard that processes tweets with a specific hashtag (e.g., `#GrowWithGroqHack`), analyzes their sentiment using Groq-accelerated transformer models, and visualizes the results in a Streamlit dashboard.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Tweet Processing**: Simulates or fetches tweets with configurable hashtags
- **Groq-Powered Sentiment Analysis**: Uses transformer models for accurate sentiment classification
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes sentiment distribution, trending words, and latest tweets
- **Alert System**: Sends Slack notifications when negative sentiment spikes are detected
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Shows trending words from processed tweets
- **Color-Coded Tweets**: Visual indicators for positive, neutral, and negative sentiment

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Groq API access (optional for real deployment)
- Slack Webhook URL (for alert functionality)
